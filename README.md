# 🔍 Spencer Schwellenbach — 2024 Rookie Season Analysis

This project highlights the emergence of **Spencer Schwellenbach**, a promising pitching prospect for the Atlanta Braves who made his MLB debut on **May 29, 2024**, against the Nationals. The analysis focuses on his **pitch arsenal**, **release point consistency**, and the **adjustments** made early in his rookie campaign.

---

## 🧵 Project Summary

### 🧑‍🚀 Prospect Outlook

- Schwellenbach is a **fastball-dominant righty**, regularly touching the **upper 90s**.
- Features a nasty **mid-80s sweeping slider** that runs off the plate and into right-handed hitters’ feet.
- Shows the tools to develop into a reliable rotation piece for the Braves.

### 🎯 Release Point Analysis

One standout observation in Schwellenbach’s rookie starts was the **variation in his release point**. After deeper analysis:

- **Before Start #5:** Wide scatter of release points across all pitch types.
- **After Start #5:** Noticeable consolidation — release points became **tighter and more repeatable**, a key sign of mechanical refinement and MLB-level consistency.

Visuals were generated to show this **before vs. after** adjustment and demonstrate the Braves’ development strategy.
